# video_face_recognition
Using Azure cognitive services and Python, do face recogition / detection in real time videos.

I always like to watch TV series, the ones related to police investigations were the best for me... and I was watching some old episodes of a serie (the date of the episodes was very close to the year 2000) and back there they already did facial recognition. Then I asked myself, how can someone know how to do facial recognition 20 years ago and I still don´t know how to do it? Now I´ve changed this. Using Azure congnitive services API (Free BTW) I´m training models to do face recognition in live videos and also face detection. In the next lines I´ll try to explain how to access the Azure API, create and train models, export the results to the cloud and start the data engineering process with the data generated by the script. So, let´s start.
