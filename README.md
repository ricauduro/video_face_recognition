# video_face_recognition
Using Azure cognitive services and Python, do face recogition / detection in real time videos.

  I always like to watch TV series, the ones related to police investigations were the best for me... and I was watching some old episodes of a serie (the date of the episodes was very close to the year 2000) and back there they already did facial recognition. Then I asked myself, how can someone know how to do facial recognition 20 years ago and I still don´t know how to do it? Now I´ve changed this. Using Azure congnitive services API (Free BTW) I´m training models to do face recognition in live videos and also face detection. In the next lines I´ll try to explain how to access the Azure API, create and train models, export the results to the cloud and start the data engineering process with the data generated by the script. So, let´s start.

  Most part of the logic I got from the quick start of the MS Face Recognition service <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/quickstarts-sdk/identity-client-library?tabs=visual-studio&pivots=programming-language-python> and for Face Detection <https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395236>. This second link is not detailed as the first one, but we´re goint to do a POST request of the image, GET the landmarks and then draw in the screen with OpenCV.
